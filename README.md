# Checkpoint App

<mark>Efficiently manage participants in activities!</mark>


Driven by the restrictions and unsatisfactory user experience encountered with an attendance system I have personally utilized,
I embarked on a project with a dual purpose: to deepen my knowledge of React.js and UX design. 
The primary aim of this endeavor is to develop an initial prototype that possesses the potential for future expansion, 
incorporating additional features such as face check-in, while ensuring seamless performance on mobile devices.
